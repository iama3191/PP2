## Description

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a game played to settle differences between two people. The game is taught to kids to resolve their own disputes without adult intervention. However, this game requires quick thinking and perceptive reasoning.
The original version has three options: rock, paper and scissors. This is a very simple game with 3 possible combinations for the victory:

- Rock crushes scissors.
- Scissors cut paper.
- Paper covers rock.

And with three possible results:

- Win
- Lose
- Draw

When children play the game, their decisions are made randomly. However, when adults play, the players tend to reason how their opponent will play making the game mentally challenging.
